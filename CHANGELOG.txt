CJAX 5.0-Beta2
June 01, 2012

* Support for PATH INFO  style URL
	
	eg: ajax.php/controller/function
	
	This adds to the already  plenty of supported URLS in the list:
	ajax.php?$controller/$function
	ajax.php?controller=$controller&function=$function
	ajax.php/$controller/$function
	
	With Mod-Rewrite:
	
	ajax/$controller/$function
	or:
	*Anything*/$controller/$function
	*Anything* - a word of your choosing by changing the  word "ajax" in file .htaccess
	
* Fixed issues with IE 7 not working
	All basic functionality and ajax operations are operational in IE7, but  there might be other issues - see "known issues".

* Other small improvements in request handling, and dealing with controllers that have constructors.

Known Issues:
	OveLay,overLayContent some formatting dis-perfections on IE7.
	Other small bugs/issues on IE7. Some demos may not work on IE7.
	Ajax Files Uploads works in IE7 but, it opens a new window uninvitedly.
	

* Fixed issue that if controller had the same name as the method function being called it would call the contructor, 
	and as a result execute the twice. Made it so that it gracefully handles such requests, 
	and  check if a constructor exists. If a method is not passed, it will fire the contructor.

Known Issues:
	Some of the demos don't work on IE.
	
CJAX 5.0-Beta

* Extension of plugins API and plugins documentation

	Plugins Javascript API has be released
	
	Plugins PHP API has been released
	
	There are so many new goodies for the plugin system that not many of them will get to be mentioned here.
	See "how to create a plugin" in the Examples zip for samples and documentation.
	a "Example Plugin" has been released,  examples and documentation within the code on how to build a 
	basic plugin with Javascript and advanced plugins using PHP.
	This package includes  two plugins, an advanced plugin featuring PHP and Javascript, and A basic one simply 
	in Javascript no php. Support for callbacks in Javascript Ajax - see samples in plugin docs. There is full debug
	information available for plugins, use $ajax->debug = true; to see debug information in firebug console.
	
    
* Overall Core
	Some of the  core functionality was re-written entirely to be flexible enough to provide entrance to a very powerful
	plugin system, and overall improvements of the system. Now the API bridge system that connects JavaScript and PHP is even closer,
 	Full support for local scope development for plugins, in both Javascript and PHP. 
 	Removed low usability functions, to favor effiency and clean code.
 	
* Improved Cross domain ajax to fall back on fsockopen() if cURL is not found.

* New Plugin jQuery "Uploadify" PHP has been released
  This plugin makes use of jQuery and jQuery.uploadify to bring this plugin to you in a full PHP environment.

* Plugin jQuery validate has backward compatibility with 5.0
 
* Import, - support to import Javascript and Css files:
	Examples:
	
	Import files  asynchronously
	
	$ajax->import("http://path/To/Your/Javascript.js");
	$ajax->import("http://path/To/Your/css.css");
	
	OR
	
	imports() - in contrast, waits for the previous files in list to fully load before loading the next one.
	
	$ajax->imports(array("path/To/Your/file2.js","path/To/Your/file3.js",path/To/Your/file1.css"));
	
	For plugins - they all inherit local scope,  say:
	
	$myplugin()->import("file.js"); 
	would load file "file.js" located in "myplugin" directory under plugins.
	all core functions inherited can be overwritten by plugins providing more power to each plugin.

* In your Ajax Controller, if you return an array or an object, it will be converted to json automatically.

* Performance improvements were made to an already fast system, now it's lightning fast.
	Test Speed? - try the recursive ajax request example included in the samples zip, and see how fast this framework works..    

* The minimized version of the Javascript library is now by default used.
	cjax.js the ajax Javascript library now also has enumerated version in file name, eg: cjax-5.0.js

* Stability improvements - some changes were implemented to assure stability when executing functions of imported files.

* Preload - a new preload functionality now exists, all imports are already set in preload mode.
	All preloads gain high execution priority instantly.

* Ajax Uploads   - now supports multiple file uploads, takes any files you put in a form. 
	It also handles arrays of files. Any files you throw in a form will be uploaded through AJAX.
	Demo updated in the demos zip. New API function $ajax->upload() was added. No controller
	is required all the processing is built in. Recognizes most errors. Suports custom settings in $ajax->upload(), 
	the API documentation has be updated, see API for more info. 

* $ajax->form() parameter form_id is no longer required if used in context of $ajax->Exec(), the form is automatically pulled from
	the event_element_id parent form, (the first parameter in $ajax->Exec(). You can still specify the form_id but is no longer required.
	
* $ajax->call()  and $ajax->form() now shared  some of the  same source code, this helps to keep consistancy and illiminate some redundancy.

  ajax.php?$controller/$function/$arg1/$arg2

* Changed how methods are called, although in testing it seems stable, this is considered a release candidate for additinal testing.

CJAX 4.0 Stable release

May 2, 2012

+ Cjax development has been slow this year. The ajax framework has been  very stable.
	Gone through over a year of testing and usage without major bugs found. A few minor bugs were fixed and
	a few enhancements and improvements were made.

+ Automatically detects Jquery can execute commands while the requests being made with jquery, automatically. 

* Alternative integration with Codeignater has been done, no known bugs.


CJAX 3.1 RC3

February 19 2011


+ Improved security. 
	Now no longer can someone access ajax.php directly in the browser. This is done for security reasons
	and closes doors to further vulnerability.

+ New flag system was implemented
	The new flag system allows for further costumization of the already flexibly ajax system.
	The flag system allow for the usage of $ajax->setFlags(); functionality.
	This functionally also triggered the addition of new constant flags defitions.
	Usage Example:
	
	$flags = array('FLAG_WAIT'=> CJAX::FLAG_NO_WAIT, 'FLAG_ELEMENT_GETTER'=> CJAX::FLAG_ELEMENT_BY_ID);
	
	$ajax->setFlags( flags , 3);
	
	FLAG_WAIT = skips any awaiting time set with $cjax->wait();
	FLAG_ELEMENT_GETTER = tells the function that the element to be used next is to be gotten by itself class name not its id.
	We strongly recommand not replace ids for other type of property as it is not reliable. Try to set ids for all elements needed.
	
	These flags themselves are only two, but the system implemented allows for extensive usage of new flags. 
	Including furter interaction with plugins.
	
	The example above shows how to set flags for the next set of commands, the flags are already defined constant
	you can find within CJAX,  the second parameter is the number of future commands it will affect.
	If not specified, then it will set flags only for the next command without affecting the rest.

====================================
CJAX 3.1 RC2
February 18 2011



* Changed the usaged of $CJAX as official variable to $ajax - a more generic way.
	CJAX class is still instanciated by calling CJAX::getInstance(). This will not change.

+ Implemented and optimized internal timer to be able to run for long instances.
	The present internal timer was optimized and tested to run as per-need basis. This has been extended and optionmized
	to handle long periods to interpret and execute commands.
	

* New function CJAX.get.byClassName(); 
	Gets the first element which cointains a specific class, used when a element id is not available in the document.
	It is recommended to always assign id to all appropriate elements for faster, and more reliable results.

* Example Package was extended
	New example are available wihin the ajax package as some usage examples.
	+simple Alert (this is one of the simplest usages, but could give a good starting point for someone wanting to do bigger things)
	+bind_commands - shows how to bind nested command in one execute command.
	+confirm_action
	+simple value assignment
	+overlay - rather than a command, this is a full functionality.
	+messages - rather than a command, this is a full functionality.
	+upload_file - rather than a command, this is a full functionality.
	+ajax_call - example to create simple ajax calls.
	+send_input - simple example how to send input to elements
	+real_time - this is not command, this is a functionality sample.
	+parameters - shows how to send an ajax call with paramenters
	+post - post requests to the server.
	+propagate dropdowns -  rather than a command, this sample is a functionality.
	+send_form - how to submit a form using ajax.
	
	for more samples look inside the samples directory in the CJAX package.
